# Capability Evaluation

`eval/` contains the repository-local capability evaluation coordinator. It can evaluate this
project's server, another local OpenAI-compatible service, or a remote online model. The inference
engine is only one possible target; its single-sequence limitation is represented by
`max_concurrency: 1`, not built into the framework.

EvalScope is the first real evaluation backend. The coordinator, configuration, logging, progress,
resume, and result contracts do not import or depend on EvalScope. The deterministic `mock` backend
can exercise those contracts without a model service or network access.

## Environment

Create the isolated environment with the repository's canonical Python:

```bash
python3 -m venv eval/.venv
eval/.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r eval/requirements.txt
```

The pinned initial stack is EvalScope 1.9.0, `bfcl-eval==2025.10.27.1`, and the BFCL runtime
dependency `soundfile==0.14.0`. Dataset and model caches remain owned by their upstream libraries.
Installing dependencies does not download the Qwen model or create a `.ninfer` artifact.

## Configuration

See [`configs/capability-suite.yaml`](configs/capability-suite.yaml) for the initial AIME25,
AIME26, GPQA-Diamond, and BFCL-v4 suites, and [`configs/mock-suite.yaml`](configs/mock-suite.yaml)
for a network-free example.

[`configs/qwen3_6_35b_needle_haystack.yaml`](configs/qwen3_6_35b_needle_haystack.yaml)
defines the 35B-A3B Needle-in-a-Haystack profiles separately: `standard` preserves EvalScope's
1K--32K, ten-length, ten-depth English/Chinese matrix (200 samples), while `native_long` evaluates
the exact 64K, 128K, and safe 260K prompt profiles at eleven depths in both languages (66 samples).
The 260K profile uses the exact local 35B tokenizer and leaves more than 2K native context tokens
for chat framing and its bounded 512-token answer. All profiles use rule scoring and explicitly
disable thinking so the observable answer is the retrieved needle.

A target defines the model service:

```yaml
targets:
  model_api:
    protocol: openai_chat
    base_url: http://127.0.0.1:18080/v1
    model: qwen3.6-27b
    api_key_env: MODEL_API_KEY   # optional; omit for an unauthenticated endpoint
    max_concurrency: 1
    request:
      timeout_seconds: 3600
      retries: 2
```

API keys must come from environment variables. Literal `api_key`, `Authorization`, and
`x-api-key` configuration is rejected so secrets cannot enter saved effective configurations.

Concurrency has two levels:

- `runtime.max_parallel_jobs` controls concurrently active dataset jobs;
- target `max_concurrency` caps aggregate requests to that endpoint;
- optional job `max_concurrency` caps how many target slots one job may reserve.

For EvalScope, the granted job slots become `eval_batch_size`. Multiple jobs sharing a target can
never reserve more slots than the target capacity. Set the local `ninfer-serve` target to one; set a
larger explicit value for an online service that supports it.

Portable generation settings live under `generation`. Evaluator-specific controls live under
`backend_args`; unknown fields are rejected rather than silently ignored.

## Commands

Set `PYTHONPATH` because this is a repository-local package:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/eval"
```

Validate configuration and installed runtime dependencies:

```bash
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval validate \
  --config eval/configs/capability-suite.yaml --suite smoke
```

Show expected work without making model requests:

```bash
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval plan \
  --config eval/configs/capability-suite.yaml --suite reasoning
```

Add `--check-runtime` to resolve configured secret environment variables and check pinned backend
packages.

Run the network-free coordinator check:

```bash
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval run \
  --config eval/configs/mock-suite.yaml --suite all
```

Run the small real-endpoint matrix before a formal evaluation:

```bash
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval run \
  --config eval/configs/capability-suite.yaml --suite smoke
```

Then run the full reasoning and BFCL suites independently:

```bash
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval run \
  --config eval/configs/capability-suite.yaml --suite reasoning

SERPAPI_API_KEY=... eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval run \
  --config eval/configs/capability-suite.yaml --suite bfcl_full
```

Prepare and inspect Needle-in-a-Haystack without issuing model requests:

```bash
eval/.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r eval/requirements.txt
eval/.venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
from modelscope import dataset_snapshot_download
print(dataset_snapshot_download(
    'AI-ModelScope/Needle-in-a-Haystack-Corpus',
    allow_file_pattern=['PaulGraham_Essays.txt', 'Journey_to_the_West.txt'],
))
PY
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval plan \
  --config eval/configs/qwen3_6_35b_needle_haystack.yaml --suite standard --check-runtime
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval plan \
  --config eval/configs/qwen3_6_35b_needle_haystack.yaml --suite native_long --check-runtime
```

Run the one-sample NIAH smoke only after the active model evaluation has released the single target
slot, then select `standard` or `native_long` as a separate formal run.

BFCL-v4 full evaluation contains 5,106 samples. Multi-turn samples can make more than one model
request. Its Web Search subsets require `SERPAPI_API_KEY`; `memory_vector` may download an upstream
model, which the example explicitly acknowledges with `allow_network_downloads: true`.

Inspect and resume a run:

```bash
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval status --run eval/runs/<run-id>
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval resume --run eval/runs/<run-id>
eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval summarize --run eval/runs/<run-id>
```

Resume rejects a changed effective configuration or backend version. Completed jobs are skipped;
an incomplete EvalScope job reuses its own prediction cache when available.

## Progress And Logs

TTY runs use a live display with dataset phase, completed/total units, elapsed time, rate, and ETA.
Non-TTY runs print periodic heartbeats without ANSI cursor control. Unknown totals remain `?`; the
framework does not invent a percentage or ETA.

Every run is stored below `eval/runs/<timestamp>-<config-hash>/`:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `effective-config.yaml` | validated, secret-free effective configuration |
| `manifest.json` | git state, environment, backend versions, target and concurrency provenance |
| `state.json` | atomically updated operational and resume state |
| `events.jsonl` | append-only structured progress and lifecycle events |
| `run.log` | human-readable timestamps, progress, retries, and failures |
| `backends/<job>/` | unchanged backend-native predictions, logs, cache, and reports |
| `summary.json` | versioned normalized result contract |
| `summary.md` | compact human-readable score table |

The sample-retention policy is recorded in the manifest. API keys and known secret values are
redacted from coordinator events and task snapshots.

## Scores

Each benchmark remains independently reportable. The framework does not average AIME, GPQA, and
BFCL into an invented cross-benchmark score.

- AIME25 and AIME26 report rule-scored accuracy over 30 samples each.
- GPQA-Diamond reports accuracy over 198 samples.
- BFCL-v4 reports its official `agentic`, `multi_turn`, `live`, `non_live`, `hallucination`, and
  `overall` values when the full score-bearing suite is complete.

A partial or failed job makes the run `partial` or `failed`; an incomplete BFCL run is never labeled
as the official full BFCL score.

## Adding Evaluations

An ordinary EvalScope dataset needs only another configured job:

```yaml
- id: new_dataset
  backend: evalscope
  dataset: evalscope_dataset_name
  target: model_api
  generation:
    temperature: 0
  backend_args:
    subset_list: [subset_name]
```

An evaluator that does not use EvalScope implements the four-method backend protocol in
`ninfer_eval/backends/base.py`, registers one stable name in `backends/registry.py`, retains its raw
artifacts, and returns the normalized `DatasetResult`. The coordinator and summary writer do not
need benchmark-specific changes.

## Exit Status

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0 | completed successfully, or status query for an active run |
| 2 | invalid configuration or missing configured secret |
| 3 | missing/incompatible backend dependency |
| 4 | partial evaluation |
| 5 | failed evaluation or missing run artifact |
| 6 | cancelled evaluation |

## Verification

```bash
PYTHONPATH=eval eval/.venv/bin/python -m py_compile $(rg --files eval/ninfer_eval -g '*.py')
PYTHONPATH=eval eval/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s eval/tests -p 'test_*.py'
PYTHONPATH=eval eval/.venv/bin/python -m ninfer_eval run \
  --config eval/configs/mock-suite.yaml --suite all
```
