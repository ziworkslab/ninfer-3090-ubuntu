 * Op: linear_swiglu
 *
 * Math / indexing:
 *   gate_up = Linear(x, gate_up_weight); M=gate_up_rows/2;
 *   ideal[i,t] = SiLU(gate_up[i,t]) * gate_up[M+i,t].
 *
 * Logical shapes / supported domain:
 *   T may be any positive value. The registered RowSplit profiles are:
 *   - Q4G64_F16S weight [34816,5120], x [5120,T], out [17408,T];
 *   - W8G32_F16S weight [12288,2048], x [2048,T], out [6144,T];
 *   - NVFP4 BlockScaleK16M128x4 weight [34816,5120], x [5120,T], out [17408,T].
 *   Inputs and output are contiguous BF16. Q4/W8 scales are FP16; NVFP4 scales are E4M3FN.
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   The oracle exact-decodes the registered weight and evaluates `ideal` naively in FP64 from the
 *   represented inputs. The BF16 output is promoted and compared directly with that result; output
 *   storage rounding belongs to LinearSwiGLU's named activation-compute criterion, not the oracle.
 *   Production routes may fuse or materialize gate/up and may choose their natural accumulator,
 *   staging, and workspace precision; those private choices are not semantic rounding boundaries.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Writes the full output; x/weight and output must not alias.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   Caller-owned transient storage reported by linear_swiglu_workspace_capacity_bytes(),
 *   scoped to the call. W8 and fused NVFP4 A16 require zero bytes; W4A4 routes use caller-owned
 *   activation and, where selected, private projection storage. There is no persistent state side
 *   effect.
