 *   k[:,t]    = linear(x[:,t], query_key_weight[6144:7168,:])

 *
 * All tensors are contiguous BF16. Shapes are x [5120,T], q/gate [6144,T], and k/v [1024,T].
 * T may be any positive value.
 * The two parent weights are RowSplit [7168,5120] with FP16 scales and group size 64:
 * query_key is Q4G64_F16S and gate_value is Q5G64_F16S. The oracle exact-decodes each row and
 * evaluates every projection naively in FP64 from the represented inputs. The BF16 outputs are
 * promoted and compared directly with those ideal values; final output storage rounding belongs
 * to AttnInputProj's named A16 criterion, not the oracle. Production routes choose their private
 * accumulator and staging precision. Inputs and the four outputs must be mutually non-overlapping.
 * Current registered routes require no transient allocation. The Op has no persistent state side
 * effect.

 * Computes the single-parent Q/K/output-gate/V projection.
 *
 * The parent stores rows in physical order query, key, output gate, value while the public output
 * argument order is q, gate, k, v. Every route writes the four independently contiguous final
 * allocations directly; no packed parent output is materialized. The NVFP4 A4 profile may use
 * caller-owned transient storage for its private quantized activation.
 *
 * Registered parent forms are:
 *
 * - W8G32_F16S RowSplit `[9216,2048]`, with row counts `[4096,512,4096,512]`. `x` is
 *   BF16 `[2048,T]`, q/gate are BF16 `[4096,T]`, and k/v are BF16 `[512,T]`.
 * - BF16_CTRL Contiguous `[14336,5120]`, with row counts `[6144,1024,6144,1024]`. `x` is
 *   BF16 `[5120,T]`, q/gate are BF16 `[6144,T]`, and k/v are BF16 `[1024,T]`.
 * - NVFP4 BlockScaleK16M128x4 `[14336,5120]`, with the same logical row and tensor shapes as
 *   BF16_CTRL.
 *
 * `T` is the positive token extent of the Op contract. BF16_CTRL and W8G32_F16S admit only
 * LinearPolicy::A16Only. NVFP4 admits A16Only and AllowA4; AllowA4 permits the private resolver to
 * select either a qualified A16 route or activation quantization to NVFP4 at every positive T.
 *
 * The oracle evaluates every projection independently with naive FP64 accumulation from the
 * logical values represented by the persistent weight and BF16 activation. The final four BF16
 * stores belong to the Op's criterion for the selected activation-compute path.
 *
 * `workspace` is caller-owned call-scoped transient storage sized by
 * attn_input_proj_workspace_capacity_bytes(). It must not overlap the input, parent weight, or any
 * output. The Op does not allocate device memory internally.
