 * Computes two same-shaped projections of one input:

 *   second_out[:,t] = linear(x[:,t], second_weight).
 *
 * `x` is contiguous BF16 [K,T], both outputs are distinct contiguous BF16 [N,T], and both
 * weights have the same logical [N,K] shape and RowSplit W8G32_F16S encoding with FP16 scales.
 * The registry admits the paired [1024,5120] physical projection and the exact adjacent
 * [1024,2048] K/V row views (parent rows [4096,5120) and [5120,6144)) for every positive T.
 * Numeric semantics are those of linear(). Inputs, outputs, and weight planes must be mutually
 * non-overlapping. The Op requires no caller-owned transient storage and has no persistent state
 * side effect.
