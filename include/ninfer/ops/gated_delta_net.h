 * and state FP32 [128,128,Hv], where Hqk>=1, Hv>=Hqk, and Hv%Hqk==0. `scale` is 1/sqrt(128). When
 * `normalize_qk` is true, the recurrent implementation consumes raw q/k and applies
 * x / sqrt(sum(x^2) + 1e-6) independently to every 128-element row before using it. When false,
 * q/k are consumed as supplied. The oracle evaluates the complete recurrence and `ideal` naively
 * in FP64 from the represented inputs and FP32 initial state. The BF16 out is promoted and
 * compared directly with that result; output storage rounding belongs to the Op's numerical
 * criterion, not the oracle. Recurrent implementations may apply the normalization directly;
 * chunked implementations may use private normalized staging. The corresponding private storage
 * is included by gated_delta_net_workspace_capacity_bytes when `normalize_qk` is true.
 * Inputs and out do not overlap state or one another. `ws` supplies transient storage reported by
 * gated_delta_net_workspace_capacity_bytes; scratch is scoped to the call. T may be any positive
 * value.
 *
 * This overload reads and writes the same `ssm_state`, publishing the state after all T tokens.
