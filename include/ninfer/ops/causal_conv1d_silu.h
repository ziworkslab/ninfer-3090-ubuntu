 *
 *   ideal[c,t] = SiLU(sum_{j=0..3} weight[c,j] * u[c,t-3+j]).
 *
 * `x` and `out` are contiguous BF16 [C,T], `weight` is contiguous BF16 [C,4], and a state is
 * contiguous BF16 [C,3] ordered oldest to newest. The oracle evaluates `ideal` naively in FP64 from
 * the represented inputs. The BF16 output is promoted and compared directly with that result;
 * output storage rounding belongs to the Op's numerical criterion, not the oracle. Kernel
 * accumulator and staging precision are implementation choices. Input, weight, output, and state
 * storage do not overlap except for the explicitly allowed exact alias between state input and
 * state output. No caller workspace is used. T may be any positive value.

 * initial slot may lie in its destination reservation. `conv_states` is the only persistent state
 * mutated and must not overlap x, weight, metadata, or out.
