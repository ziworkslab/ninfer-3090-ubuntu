 * Math / indexing:

 *   z[:,t]   = value_z_weight[6144:12288,:] * x[:,t]
 *
 * Logical shapes:
 *   x [5120,T], qk weight/output rows 4096, value/z rows 6144 each, qkv [10240,T],
 *   z [6144,T]. T may be any positive value. x, qkv, and z are contiguous BF16.
 *   qk_weight is Q4G64_F16S RowSplit [4096,5120] and value_z_weight is one
 *   Q5G64_F16S RowSplit parent [12288,5120] in [value,z] row order, both with FP16 scales.
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   The oracle exact-decodes both weight parents and evaluates all four logical projections
 *   naively in FP64 from the represented input. The BF16 qkv and z outputs are promoted and
 *   compared directly with those ideal values; final output storage rounding belongs to
 *   GdnInputProj's named A16 criterion, not the oracle. Production routes may choose their
 *   private precision independently; every registered route writes both final allocations.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Writes the full qkv and z outputs; inputs and outputs must not alias.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   No transient bytes are required.

 * The first three ranges are written contiguously to qkv and the final range is written to z.
 * W8 admits A16 only. NVFP4 admits A16Only and AllowA4; AllowA4 permits private activation
 * quantization at every positive T. Every route writes the two
 * independent final allocations directly. The complete projection is evaluated against the same
 * exact-decode/naive-FP64 oracle; activation quantization and the production reduction profile are
 * private effects covered by the selected criterion. x, qkv, and z must be pairwise
 * non-overlapping.
 *
 * The policy-bearing form uses caller-owned call-scoped transient storage sized by
 * gdn_input_proj_workspace_capacity_bytes(). A16 requires zero bytes. The convenience overload
 * selects A16Only and requires no transient workspace.

 *
 * Math / indexing:
 *   For each row b, let p[:,j,b] be the concatenated q/k/value projection of x[:,j,b], while
 *   z[:,j,b] is the independent z projection. Starting from the BF16 width-three history selected
 *   by initial_state_slots[b], evaluate the width-four depthwise convolution over p, apply SiLU,
 *   and publish its channel ranges to query, key, and value. After valid column j, write the new
 *   width-three history to snapshot_base_slots[b]+j. Z bypasses convolution.
 *
 * Logical shapes:
 *   The 27B registered form has x [5120,W,B], Q4 q/k weight [4096,5120], one Q5 value/z parent
 *   [12288,5120], conv_weight [10240,4], conv_states [10240,3,Slots], query/key [2048,W,B],

 *   W=1..16. `valid_columns` is empty for a dense invocation or I32 [B] for a mixed-width batch.
 *   A mixed-width invocation has B>=1 and every valid extent lies in [1,W].
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   The oracle exact-decodes packed weights and evaluates projection, convolution, SiLU, z, and
 *   every snapshot value naively in FP64 from represented inputs. BF16 query/key/value/z and
 *   snapshots are promoted and compared directly with those ideal values; their final storage
 *   rounding belongs to the Op's named A16 criterion, not the oracle. Former unfused projection
 *   tensors are not observable cast boundaries; production routes use their natural private
 *   accumulator and staging precision. This two-parent Q4/Q5 form does not quantize activation;
 *   the single-parent policy-bearing form below defines its own permitted compute profiles.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Each row writes query/key/value through its valid prefix and exact zero to its invalid tail;
 *   z is projected for all B*W safe input columns. A row writes only its valid destination state
 *   prefix. The caller reserves disjoint complete [base,base+W) intervals, prevents one row from
 *   overwriting another row's initial slot, and may overlap a row's own initial slot with its
 *   destination after that initial history has been loaded. Other slots are unchanged. Newly
 *   projected convolution channels remain private to the call while published snapshots are BF16.
