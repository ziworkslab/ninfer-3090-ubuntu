/**
 * Op: speculative_accept_greedy_drafts
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   Independently for each row b, greedy mode accepts the longest available draft prefix matching
 *   target_tokens and commits the target token at the first mismatch (or the bonus column).
 *   Sampling mode applies configs[b] to each valid verification column, accepts draft i with
 *   target probability p_i(draft_i), samples from the residual distribution on first rejection,
 *   and samples a bonus from column Pcur[b] when every available draft is accepted. The draft
 *   proposal distribution is one-hot at each greedy draft token.
 *   RNG domains are the speculative accept/correction/bonus SamplePurpose values and logical
 *   positions derived from the old length.
 *
 * Logical shapes:
 *   All Tensor storage is contiguous. target_tokens/licensed_tokens are I32 [K+1,B], drafts is
 *   I32 [K,B], logits is BF16 [physical_rows,K+1,B], and current_extents/lengths/anchors/
 *   licensed_counts/accepted are I32 [B]. token_domain is in [1,physical_rows], K>=1, B>=1, and
 *   configs points to a device-resident SamplingConfig[B]. Tensor arguments, configs, and
 *   configs[b].token_counts do not overlap except for the explicitly mutated objects.
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   Sampling filtering, penalties, normalization, and RNG semantics are those of sampling.h.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   For each row, let A be the accepted draft count and L=A+1. licensed_tokens[0:A,b] receives
 *   accepted drafts, licensed_tokens[A,b] receives the correction/bonus token, and the remaining
 *   physical slots are zero. licensed_counts[b]=L; accepted[b]=A; anchors[b] becomes the
 *   correction/bonus token; lengths[b]+=L. In sampling mode, each produced token increments
 *   configs[b].token_counts when that pointer is non-null. Greedy mode does not update
 *   token_counts. current_extents and all other inputs remain unchanged. Request statistics are
 *   deliberately outside this Op.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   Caller-owned transient storage reported by
 *   speculative_accept_greedy_drafts_workspace_capacity_bytes().
