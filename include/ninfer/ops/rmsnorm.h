 * Applies RMSNorm over the fastest dimension D=ne[0]. For each logical row r:

 *   inv_r    = 1 / sqrt((1/D) * sum_d x[d,r]^2 + eps)
 *   gain[d]  = unit_offset ? 1 + weight[d] : weight[d]
 *   ideal[d,r] = x[d,r] * inv_r * gain[d].
 *
 * `x` and `out` are same-shaped contiguous BF16 tensors, weight is contiguous BF16 [D], and eps
 * is positive and finite. Input, weight, and output must not overlap. The oracle evaluates `ideal`
 * naively in FP64 from the represented inputs. The BF16 output is promoted and compared directly
 * with that result; output storage rounding belongs to the Op's numerical criterion, not the
 * oracle. Kernel reduction, staging, and accumulator precision are implementation choices. There
 * is no workspace or persistent state side effect.
